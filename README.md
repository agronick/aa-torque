# Android Auto Plugin for Torque

[![ci][1]][2]

This was a performance monitor, based on [Chillout's Performance Monitor](https://github.com/jilleb/mqb-pm) which was based on Martoreto's aa-stats.
The app has been modified with a focus on making it more customizable with the ability
to obtain any PID from Torque. Torque pro is required to use this app.

# Main features:
- Display data from Torque
- Many themes and backgrounds to choose from
- Up to 10 dashboards
- Rotary dial support

# Screenshots:

# Installation instructions:

Download the latest release here: https://github.com/agronick/performance-monitor/releases

- Install [Torque Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- Make sure Android Auto is in developer mode: Open Android Auto (while not connected to the car), go to About. Tap the "About Android Auto" header 10 times until you see a toast message saying you're a developer. From the right top corner select developer options, scroll down and make sure you check "Unknown sources". This will allow programs from non-Playstore apps to be run on Android Auto. See a picture guide how to enable Developer mode here: https://www.howtogeek.com/271132/how-to-enable-developer-settings-on-android-auto/
- Install the Performance Monitor apk using [Kingstaller](https://github.com/fcaronte/KingInstaller/releases) so your phone thinks it came from the play store
- Open the Performance Monitor settings, grant all the rights it's requesting. If you don't do this, the app will NOT work.
- Hook your phone to your car's USB, start Android Auto on your unit.
- You can find the AA Torque in the menu on the lower right in Android Auto, the one with the dashboard clock on it.
